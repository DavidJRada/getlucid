# Get Lucid

##Purpose:

Lucid dreaming is becoming aware of your dreams and shaping your dream world anyway you want.

The goal of this app is to keep track of your dreams every night (even nights that you don't dream). The intention is to start thinking about dreaming during your waking life so that you can think about dreaming while in the dream and become aware that you are dreaming to take control.

The site starts with the Sleep styling as the user would typically have just woken up. They can choose whether they are going back to sleep or waking up and depending on their selection the color scheme will be different to accommodate the situation.

##Process

##Technologies 
This site uses an Express Server with EJS and Mongoose for the backend. Method Override is used for the Post and Delete routes. There is Bcrypt for encrypting passwords and express sessions to allow continuity for users after they log in.

##Difficulties

- Figuring out how to pass the chosen css styling for the entire user experience
- Users and sessions took a lot of thought and work to get it working, but much more could be done to make it more seamless and comprehensive
- 

##Future

- Add a sleep tracker portion to track and display nightly sleep
- Include a modal on the home page to display one of the videos I have used or have them carousel through the videos by clicking a button to learn more
- Reformat the date on the cards
- Additional content on theories and research around Lucid Dreaming
- More interesting or psychedelic backgrounds, possibly add a button to make the background more interesting (trippy, counting sheep, calming moods etc)
- Add music to go along with mood of background
